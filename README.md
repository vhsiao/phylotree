We’re working on a web application to display the evolution of species. Our project is an interactive viewer for phylogenetic trees. In evolutionary biology, phylogeny is the study of how species are related to one another. A phylogenetic tree is a way to show these relationships,  like a family tree for groups of species. 

In our tree viewer, each species will be represented as an animated, interactive node, with connections based upon evolutionary relationships. Currently, there are very few good ways for people to easily explore evolutionary data for all species on Earth. Using PhyloTree, you can see the process of species discovery in action.

As you move a slider to adjust the date range you want to see, nodes will collapse into the tree, and new nodes will appear. It will be simple to adjust the tree’s root, click through each node and query the enormous database of species information available from itiis.gov. We have plans to make our project easily extensible for other developers. 

The D3.js library will help display data as interactive nodes that respond to one another and flow across the screen. In summary, we are making a tool that can be used by scientists, students and enthusiasts to better visualize and interact with the vast quantities of data about life on earth.
