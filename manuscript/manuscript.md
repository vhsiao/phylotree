# Dynamic interaction with phylogenetic trees


	## Viewing large phylogenies

		### Tree Structure
		A phylogeny is a number of repeated subdivision of organisms based on evolutionary similarities. It attempts to retrace the subdivision process of evolution itself, where the phenotypes within one species diverge until two or more distinct species materialize and give rise to further subdivisions. It is probable that all organisms on Earth originated from a single common ancestor, the theoretical "root" of the tree.

		Taxonomy is a system of classification related to phylgeny. 

		### Data reduction
		There are 367717 usable entries in the ITIS database from the Animal kingdom. We wanted all of this information available for the user to access at once. At the same time, such a large number of nodes is difficult to access and interact with. In addition, rendering these data as interactive nodes overburdens the browser. Our goal was to allow people to explore this large number of species in an intuitive way. The user should be able to easily navigate to neighboring regions in the tree, as well as jump quickly to a region of interest potentially far away on the tree.
